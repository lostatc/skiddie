"""Games to play in the terminal.

Games in this package should have a main function that accepts parameters affecting how the game is played. This main
function must return once the game is complete. For each game added to this package, you must do the following:

1) Create a corresponding Markdown file in `skiddie/descriptions/` containing a description of the game including how to
play it. The contents of this file should be wrapped to 80 characters.

2) Update README.md with a link to the description of the game.

3) Add an entry for the game in `skiddie/launcher/common.py`.

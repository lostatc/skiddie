A game about finding patterns in randomly generated numbers.

The game starts with multiple grid-like patterns on the screen. The pattern in
the first row is the puzzle, and the patterns below it are the possible
solutions. The objective of the game is to choose the correct solution to the
puzzle. The correct solution is the pattern which is an exact negative of the
puzzle. This means that each cell in the correct solution will be the opposite
color from the corresponding cell in the puzzle.

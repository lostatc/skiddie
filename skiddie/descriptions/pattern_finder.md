A game about finding patterns in randomly generated numbers.

The game starts with multiple grid-like patterns on the screen. The pattern on
top is the puzzle, and the patterns below it are the possible solutions. The
objective of the game is to choose the correct solution to the puzzle. The
correct solution is the pattern which is an exact negative of the puzzle. This
means that each cell in the correct solution will be the opposite color from
the corresponding cell in the puzzle. If you choose the wrong solution, you
will have to wait a number of seconds before being prompted with a new puzzle.

crackit
=======
crackit is a collection of minigames that can be played in the terminal and are
meant to emulate Hollywood-style "hacking." These games have nothing to do with
cybersecurity. Instead, they're just small puzzle games themed around the
hacking scenes found in many movies.

Features
========
* No knowledge of programming or cybersecurity required.
* Multiple difficulty settings for each game.
* Tracks your scores in a leaderboard.
* Works on all platforms.

Usage
=====
crackit comes with a terminal-based graphical user interface. To launch it,
just open a terminal and type ``crackit``. To navigate the interface, use the
keys ``Up``, ``Down``, ``Tab`` and ``Enter``.

crackit also comes with a command-line interface. For more information, run
``crackit --help``.

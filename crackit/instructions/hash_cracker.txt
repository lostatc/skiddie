A game about cracking password hashes.

The game starts with rows of characters on the screen. The objective is to type
new rows of characters until you have a certain number of rows. When adding
rows, a character cannot appear more than once in the same row or column. Also,
rows can only contain numbers and letters in the range a-f. A row will only be
accepted if it meets these criteria. You can use the arrow keys or the mouse to
move the cursor.

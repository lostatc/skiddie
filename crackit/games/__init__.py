"""Games to play in the terminal.

Games in this package should have a main function that accepts parameters affecting how the game is played. This main
function must return once the game is complete. For each game added to this package, you must do two things:

1) You must create a corresponding text file in `crackit/descriptions/` containing a description of the game including
how to play it. The contents of this file must be wrapped to 80 characters.

2) You must add an entry for the game in `crackit/launcher/common.py` including a function which defines difficulty
presets.

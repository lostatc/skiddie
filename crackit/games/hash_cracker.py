The game starts with rows of characters on the screen. The objective is to add
rows of characters until you have a certain number of rows. Rows can only
contain numbers and letters in the range a-f. A character cannot appear more
than once in the same row or column. If a row is entered that does not meet
these criteria, it is cleared.

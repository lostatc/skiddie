A game about cracking password hashes.

The game starts with rows of characters on the screen. The objective is to add
more rows of characters that meet certain criteria. A character cannot appear
more than once in the same row or column. Also, rows can only contain numbers
and letters in the range a-f. Once you enter a valid row, pressing `Enter` will
allow you to move down to the next row. You can use the arrow keys or the mouse
to move the cursor.

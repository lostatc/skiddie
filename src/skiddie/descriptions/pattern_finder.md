A game about finding patterns in a random number generator.

The game starts with multiple grid-like patterns on the screen. The pattern on
top is the puzzle, and the patterns below it are the possible solutions. The
objective of the game is to choose the solution which is an exact negative of
the puzzle. This means that each cell in the correct solution will be the
opposite color from the corresponding cell in the puzzle. If you choose the
wrong solution, you will have to wait a number of seconds before being prompted
with a new puzzle.

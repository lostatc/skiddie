# skiddie
skiddie is a collection of minigames that can be played in the terminal and are
meant to emulate Hollywood-style "hacking." These games have nothing to do with
cybersecurity. Instead, they're just small puzzle games themed around the
hacking scenes found in many movies.

## Features
* No knowledge of programming or cybersecurity required.
* Multiple difficulty settings for each game.
* Tracks your scores in a leaderboard.
* Works on all platforms.

## Usage
skiddie comes with a terminal-based graphical user interface. To launch it,
just open a terminal and type `skiddie`. To navigate the interface, use the
keys `Up`, `Down`, `Tab` and `Enter`.

skiddie also comes with a command-line interface. For more information, run
`skiddie --help`.
